# 🎯 Python Installation 🖥️

➹ Even if you're a beginner I will gratefully welcome you to this particular data science course where we would learn the use of Data Science in this Tech world with the help of **Python Programming Language** which is also recommemded regarding this field, also we would learn the basics first for covering other different topics regarding **Data Science**.

**Python** ➤ Python is one of the most popular programming languages today, known for its simplicity and ease of use. Whether you’re just starting with coding or looking to pick up another language, Python is an excellent choice. Its clean and straightforward syntax makes it beginner-friendly, while its powerful libraries and frameworks are perfect for advanced projects.
