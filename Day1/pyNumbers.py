# let us understand about the Numbers or Numerical Data Type

# getting started with defining a performing different operations on it
num1 = 23
num2 = 44

# getting the sum of these two numbers
print(num1 + num2)

# similarly we have further diffferent operations on it

print(num1 - num2)          # subtraction
print(num1 ** 2)            # power of the number
print(num1 / num2)          # division operation

# creating a variable for storing the distance of the city
distance_city = 188
distance_city2 = 247

total_distance = distance_city + distance_city2
print(total_distance)                                   # distance calculations

# finding the time overall with the given speed
mph = 65
time = total_distance / mph

# getting the time with 2 decimal points
print("The time regarding it is : " + str(round(time,2)))

# some different operations accordingly operator precedence
print(34 - (45 + 6) * 56)

# these were some mathematical operations that we can perform over to the Numbers in Python
