# variable in Python : these are some containers that are used in order to store data or values

# here let us create a variables together by assigning values to them.
rent = 23

gas = 293.2                         # float data type variables
groceries = 305.6                   # groceries values

print(rent)

total = rent + gas + groceries      # getting the total of it
print(total)

# also we can create different variables with textual values
item1 = "this is some item with textual value"
item2 = "this is another one"

# on taking variable's values we can use the already assigned names to the Python reserved keywords
"""
    defining a variable with name print will provide you an error

    print = 34          # this will surely provide you an error when the code is interpreted
    Note : But we can change the value once it is assigned to it
"""

# in further programs we will understand the use of Further different data types here
